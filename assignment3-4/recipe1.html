    <h2>4 Easy Steps to Satay Perfection!</h2>
    <div class="flex-step">
        <div class="box1">
            <img class="pic-1" src="./chicken-satay-1.jpg" alt="1">
            <h3><u>1. Make the marinade.</u></h3>
            <p>Combine coconut milk, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, curry powder, ground
                coriander, ground ginger, minced garlic, sriracha and fish sauce in a bowl.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="box2">
            <img class="pic-2" src="./chicken-satay-2.jpg" alt="2">
            <h3><u>2. Marinate the chicken.</u></h3>
            <p>Add two pounds of cubed boneless, skinless chicken breasts to the marinade,
                toss the chicken in the marinade until it’s well coated. Place in the refrigerator to marinate for 30
                minutes.
                This
                chicken is honestly so flavorful and tender after just a 30 minute marinade, but if you want to make it
                earlier,
                you
                can leave the chicken in the marinade for up to 4 hours.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="box3">
            <img class="pic-3" src="./chicken-satay-3.jpg" alt="3">
            <h3><u>3. Skewer the chicken.</u></h3>
            <p>If using wooden skewers, soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes before
                preparing the skewers. This will prevent the skewers from catching fire on the grill, pretty important
                stuff!
                Remove
                the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinating liquid. Skewer 4-5 pieces of marinated chicken
                onto
                skewers. You’ll need 10-12 metal skewers or soaked wooden skewers.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="box4">
            <img class="pic-4" src="./chicken-satay-4.jpg" alt="4">
            <h3><u>4. Grill the chicken.</u></h3>
            <p>Turn on a grill to high heat. Cooking these skewers quickly over high heat
                will give them a wonderful sear on the outside, while keeping them juicy and tender in the middle! Place
                the
                skewers
                on the grill over high heat for 3-4 minutes, flip and grill for an additional 3-4 minutes. Remove from
                the grill
                and
                top with fresh cilantro, if you’d like.</p><br>

    <h2>What should I serve with it?</h2>

    <span>Peanut Sauce</span> <br>
    <p>while this is optional, it’s also pretty standard to find chicken satay paired with peanut sauce. They really
        are a match made in heaven!</p><br>
    <span>Lettuce Leaves</span> <br>
    <p>chicken satay is delicious served as a lettuce wrap. Simply use a fork to remove the chicken from the skewers
        and place it right in an iceberg, butter or romaine lettuce leaf. Drizzle with a little peanut sauce and you’ve
        got a light, healthy meal!</p><br>
    <span>Fresh Veggies</span> <br>
    <p>as I mentioned above, I served the chicken satay with a fresh veggie tray from Vons and extra Thai peanut sauce
        for dipping the veggies. The chicken and veggie combo was light, yet still filling enough for a meal and it gave
        me the opportunity to dip two things into that absolutely delicious peanut sauce!</p><br>
    <span>Stir-Fried Veggies</span> <br>
    <p>while the chicken is marinating, you can take that time to stir fry up your favorite veggies, like broccoli,
        bell peppers, onions and sugar snap peas.</p><br>
    <span>Asian Salad</span> <br>
    <p>for an easy side, grab a bagged Asian chopped salad in the produce section at your local Vons, to pair with the
        chicken skewers.</p><br>
    <span>Cooked Rice or Quinoa </span> <br>
    <p>for a more filling side, serve the chicken satay with a side of cooked white rice, brown rice or quinoa.</p>
